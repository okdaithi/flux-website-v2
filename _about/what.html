- subheading: The Flux App
  body: 'The Flux app is the tool Australians can use to directly participate in 
    parliament in the next federal election. Vote policies not political parties, 
    immediately from your computer or smartphone on the issues you are passionate 
    about.

'
- subheading: More a celebration of democracy than a party
  body: 'Really you’re the brains of this operation. Flux is a party come election
    time but once we have elected MP’s and senators that’s where the difference begins.
    Your Flux representatives give up their autonomy and vote according to the people.
    They cast their votes in line with the outcomes produced by the Flux ecosystem
    comprised of ordinary Aussies like you.

'
- subheading: It’s still democracy, it’s just Governance 2.0
  body: 'Flux will operate in the form of an app you can access right from your computer
    or smartphone. You’ll be given a vote on every bill put before Federal Parliament,
    and can use that vote immediately on the issue at hand, give it to a trusted third
    party to cast on your behalf, or save it for an issue you care more passionately
    about later.

'
- subheading: It won’t matter where politicians stand when the floor is yours
  body: 'Flux as a party is a vehicle for driving this systemic political change,
    with no policy platform beyond parliamentary reform. Flux is a tool for changing
    how policy is shaped. It will allow more voices to join the conversation, empower
    specialists to become politically involved in their fields, and grant Australians
    direct access to producing better policy for a better Australia.

  Flux is a gateway Australians can use, to participate directly in parliament, making the need for trust in elected officials a thing of the past. Elected Flux MP’s and Senators give up their autonomy and use their votes in line with the outcomes produced by the Flux ecosystem; an ecosystem comprised of ordinary Aussies like you.

  When Flux is implemented, it will take the form of an app you can access right from your computer or smartphone. You’ll be given a vote on every bill put before Federal Parliament, and can use that vote immediately on the issue at hand, give it to a trusted third party to cast on your behalf, or save it for an issue you care more passionately about later.

  Flux as a party is a vehicle for driving this systemic political change, with no policy platform beyond parliamentary reform. Flux as a system, is a tool for changing how policy is shaped. It will allow more voices to join the conversation, empower specialists to become politically involved in their fields, and grant Australians direct access to producing better policy for a better Australia.
