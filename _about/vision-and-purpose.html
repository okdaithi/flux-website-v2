- subheading: We believe in democracy.
  body: "<p>Our mission is the distribution of real political power to include all
    Australians. <p> <p>We are a movement of political expression, not political ideology.
    We value the contribution of every Australian, no matter how great or small. We
    believe in a system which promotes autonomy, purpose, and expertise, as means
    to deliver excellent policy.</p> <p>We seek to dismantle political apathy, by
    empowering the disenfranchised, and motivating a new generation of innovative
    Australians to take responsibility for their society.</p>\n"
- subheading: We value people, not some people, but all people, and recognise our
    differences as strengths, not weaknesses.
  body: "<p>We believe in a free and open society, characterised by freedom of speech,
    freedom of association, and the free flow of political ideas.</p> <p>We are excited
    about a democracy for the information age. One which fosters constructive criticism,
    encourages innovation, and empowers our best and brightest.</p>\n"
