  This is not about me as a candidate, this is about a Party (Flux) that will bring a model of democracy (issue-based direct democracy) to the people of Australia.
  Do you ever feel politics could serve society better?
  Trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results?
  Stuck in a loop wishing "If only politicians kept their promises. If only politicians were more consultative."

  I.B.D.D is optimised for:
  <ol>
    <li>Conjecture - anyone can suggest legislation</li>
    <li>Criticism - anyone can vote on any legislation</li>
    <li>Specialisation â€“ Currently, a politician that doesn't know the ins-and-outs of a particular issue will vote along party lines without consulting you. Why not ask people with expertise in that particular area?</li>
  </ol>
- With I.B.D.D. the opportunity cost of voting will allow people to weigh up different conjectures and criticisms, drawing people to abstain from areas they aren't knowledgeable in so that they can vote in (specialise in) the areas they are interested in and have expertise in.

  You don't have to worry about me, my taste in music, or my views on a particular issue.
  All you need to know is that I believe in issue-based direct democracy.
  Having observed politics since my teens, I was drawn to Flux because I was tired of the current system - trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
  I've worked in a range of industries and community organisations as an accountant with an interest in systems thinking. I'm not getting into politics.
  I'm getting into changing politics. I look forward to working with all of NSW to bring you a voice at the Federal level all of the time.
