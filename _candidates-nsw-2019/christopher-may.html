bio: 
- Christopher May holds a Bachelor of Engineering (Sydney University) and Master of Business Administration (Macquarie University). He represented Australia in the world 12 Metre Sailing Championship in 1979 (winning a bronze medal). He has had a varied and successful business career spanning a range of areas, including executive management, operational management, financial analysis, technical delivery and technical consultancy.
- Christopher was responsible for the project leadership of the world’s first digital satellite platform (a first for Australia); namely, the Galaxy Pay-TV service, launched in 1995. Following the successful establishment of his first business in 1998 (a technical consultancy in consumer broadband services– video, data &amp; voice), Christopher subsequently established a specialist, management software business in the telecommunication industry (which now leads the world in its specialist niche market). 
- Christopher has spent a number of years overseas during his career, including, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, the UK and, most recently, a four year stint in the USA before returning to Australia in 2011. This international experience has given him a global perspective on how fortunate we are as Australians.
- Christopher is married and currently lives in the Southern Highlands, with two teenage daughters. He enjoys water sports (surfing, water skiing, and sailing) and devoting time and energy to the raising of his girls.
- Christopher has always been interested in politics and current affairs. With his varied and successful career behind him now, he looks forward to supporting Australia’s world-first, technology-based, democratic political party – The Flux Party.
