bio: 
- Tom is an innovative problem solver. By day he works as a Software Engineer for a Fortune 500 Company; by night he focuses on the bigger problems in the world.
- Tom believes that all of the biggest problems in the world today have their roots in bad politics. Flux may not be the solution to all of these problems, but it is definitely a step in the right direction.
- The NSW State Election will be Tom's second election campaign and first as a campaign manager. Tom was in charge of the digital media strategy for Flux in the WA State Election in 2017.
