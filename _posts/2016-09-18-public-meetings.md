This post explains how to watch or get involved in The Flux Party's public meetings, and outlines meeting conduct.

# Watch

If you’d just like to watch the meeting, you can find a live stream on our YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxParty](https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxParty).

# Participate

Meetings are held via Google Hangouts, with chat channels via Slack.

To join our Slack team, head over to [https://voteflux.org/slack](https://voteflux.org/slack) and dive into the channels  #livestream-chat, #livestream-motion, and #livestream-prep.

If you're invited to speak you'll need to ensure you can join a Google Hangout on demand. You won't have time to download and install the plugin on the fly, so we advise that you do this before the meeting and test it.
See [this Google support page](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/2944865?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

# Meeting Conduct

Meetings will follow an agenda, and usually be chaired by the Leader.
Minutes and action items etc, will be collated using a slack channel for convenience.

If you’d like to raise something at the meeting,  you’ll need a well prepared message to post in #livestream-motion. Any motion raised here will need 2 ‘thumbs up’ from other members (3 including the posters) in order for it to be discussed at the meeting.

If there's external documentation it should be linked, and any sizeable body of text has to be provided in advance so everyone has a chance to prepare.
Such text can be posted in #livestream-prep, and anything posted at least 24 hours before a meeting can be cited in the meeting.

# Who Participates

The default participants will be the Leader, Deputy Leader, Leadership, and official staff roles such as Secretary and Registered Officer.

Other members may be invited in as necessary, but the emphasis will be on a succinct meeting, and broader discussion is expected to occur between members outside the meeting proper.
