This is for the **legislative council** (the big ballot paper).

## How To Vote - Flux (Column I)

First, find **Flux** in the middle (column I, just to the left of Labor in column J and the Lib/Nats in column K).

### Put the number **1** in the box for Flux, above the line.

**You can stop here if you like and cast your vote.**

Then, if you like the *Voluntary Euthanasia Party*, put a 2 in Group P.

(VEP were the only party to actively engage with us, though we agreed to a slightly earlier version of Flux's proposal.)

**You can stop here if you like and cast your vote.**

All other parties [refused our offer](https://voteflux.org/flux-htvs-nsw-federal-2019/) regarding how to votes, 
so only vote for them if you really want to.

### Pick any parties or groups you like _excluding Labor, Lib/Nats, Greens, and One Nation_

**You can stop here if you like and cast your vote.**

### Pick any of the major parties (Labor, Lib/Nats, Greens, One Nation) you like

**Cast your vote.**
