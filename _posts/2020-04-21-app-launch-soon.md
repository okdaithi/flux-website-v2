We are happy to announce we will be launching the first version of our app in the coming months!

With the recent work put in by our small team of development volunteers and the backing of SecureVote's [blockchain voting technology](https://secure.vote/), we're really looking forward to launching an alpha version of DigiPol: Australia's Digital Democracy.

This is something that could really affect how people participate in Australian politics with real [issue-based direct democracy](https://voteflux.org/about/vision-and-purpose/) inside government — even before a Flux member is elected.

Here's a little bit of information to get excited about before the release in late April.

*  **A Federal Parliamentary Mirror** that displays current and outstanding bills in both houses of Parliament. Users will be able to access explanatory memorandums and readings of bills, as tabled by current MPs. You'll be able to vote yes or no on each bill and will be given the results of their voting, by electorate and as a whole of Australia.

*   **A Federal Issues Page** that displays a short, curated list of issues important to the Australian people. The issues will be curated from established interest groups, current petitioning systems\
    as well as Flux member and general public input. Similar to voting on bills, users will be able to vote yes or no on an issue and see the results from their electorate and Australia.

*   **User Profiles** that are validated against the federal electoral roll. This will automatically assign their upper and lower house representatives and help display the most relevant information for their electorate.

Over the next few weeks, we will share more information to make it easy for Flux members to explain how it all works to their friends and family. [Become a member to stay in the loop.](https://voteflux.org/signup/?utm_content=nav~)

There's plenty more planned for future beta releases; issue creation, comments sections and the like. If you would like to know more about the technical implementation of the app, you can [inspect the code repository](https://github.com/voteflux/voting_app).

If you are a developer, graphic designer or interested in UI/UX and would like to contribute, we would truly appreciate your input at this point in the process.  

For more information on how you can get involved, come and say hi on our [Discord server.](https://discord.io/FluxParty) 

Are you ready for Australia's digital democratic revolution?
